This is a comparison of the distance matrix produced by R using lc.dist and Matlab using the crappy UTM translation. 

Note that the Matlab output is in m and the R output is in km. 

Test will be how well the two match up. Do they produce the same output in terms of lat longs compared. 

Next step will be to modify the output from R to match that from Matlab then continue with the coding.
