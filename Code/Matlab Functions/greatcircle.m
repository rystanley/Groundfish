function [lat,lon,dist,bear]=greatcircle(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2,n)
%GREATCIRCLE "As the crow flies" path, distance and bearing.
%
%	[LAT,LON]=GREATCIRCLE(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2) computes the shortest
%	path along the great circle between two points defined by spherical 
%	coordinates latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees). LAT and LON 
%	contain vectors of coordinates of the way points.
%
%	[LAT,LON,DISTANCE,BEARING]=GREATCIRCLE(...) returns also vectors of
%	distances (in km) using Haversine's formula, and bearing (in degrees
%	from North) along the path way.
%
%	[...]=GREATCIRCLE(...,N) uses N intermediate points (default is 100).
%
%	Example:
%
%	  load topo
%	  contour(0:359,-90:89,topo,[0,0],'k')
%	  [lat,lon,dis] = greatcircle(48.8,2.3,35.7,139.7);
%	  hold on, plot(lon,lat,'r','linewidth',2), hold off
%	  title(sprintf('Paris to Tokyo = %g km',dis(end)))
